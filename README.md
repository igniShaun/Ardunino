# Arduniño
Arduniño is an Arduino kit for children 6+ that is play first, STEAM education second, with a target price of $6 when purchasing for quantities of 50+.

Objectives:
1) Be fun for children.
2) Be affordable enough to be given away by wonderful people.

Key Results:
1) Most children make it through introductory Level 1 exercises without loss of interest or lack of understanding.
2) Some children experiment with their own configurations.
3) Most children, when offered, want to keep the kit.

Technical constraints:
- Standalone functionality -- We can't assume the children will have access to a computer at home.
- No on-site soldering / assembling / tools should be needed -- We assume these will not be available.

Levels:
1) Preprogrammed functions / games
2) Scratch for Arduino programming at library
3) Arduino IDE tutorials at library

Hardware:
- 1 x Arduino Nano clone
- 1 x mini breadboard
- 3 x LEDs
- 1 x 220Ω resistor
- 3 x buttons
- 1 x buzzer
- 16 x breadboard wires
- 2 x breadboard-to-alligator-clip wires
- 1 x TM1637 display
